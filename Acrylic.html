			This project involves a combination of laser cutting, 3D design, and Circuit design to produce a cool custom desk lamp. Each lamp will have a 3D printed base that houses an LED strip, power source, and circuitry. A 3.5 inch square of laser engraved acrylic will be slotted into the base to produce a cool floating image where the light diffuses nicely through whichever image is cut into the sheet. This project will be complete by December of 2022 and will grant insite into the design aspect behind simple electronics.

		<h1 id = "title">About Me</h1>

		<p id = "txtbody">
			My name is Evan Poon. I am currently attending the University of Colorado, Boulder, and am pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering, as well as a Traditional Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering. From a very early age, I have found passion in computer hardware, programming, and math. I built my first computer when I was in 10th grade and, after doing so, I found myself fascinated with the complex, underlying construction of each of the various components. I wanted to truly understand how the chips and circuits worked on a fundamental level. My highschool Computer Science and Data Structures classes revealed my love of problem solving through programming as I worked with classmates to create fun projects and games  in Java. After taking these classes, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career that pertained to computers, but I wasn’t exactly sure which domain I wished to explore. My love for calculus and differential equations solidified my decision to pursue an academic and professional career in computer engineering, as the field’s combination of math, programming, and electronic design intrigued me like no other.

		<h3 id = "title">Work Experience/Project History</h3>

		<p id = "txtbody">
			As far as my work experience extends, I worked at my uncle’s Law Firm as a file manager/organizer from 7th to 12th grade (2017-2022) where I was responsible for managing/maintaining the organization of the firm’s file system. I would retrieve/stow specific files for employees/attorneys, close cases that were designated as “to-be-closed”, ensure each file cabinet was organized alphabetically, scan closed physical files to create more storage space, and rearrange the physical organization of the system to increase accessibilty. Summatively, I would maintain the organization of the file system, and if anybody needed assistance with the system, I was the person to ask.

			In my limited programming experience, I’ve completed a few notable projects that I am proud to highlight on this website (most of which can be futher examined in the "Projects" tab. A brief list of each significant one is included below.

		<h3 id = "title">Goals</h3>

		<p id = "txtbody">
			For the next five years, all of my primary goals can be universally summarized by the word "learning". Simply speaking, I wish to learn as much as I can about, well, really anything I can. I will be pursuing a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering, so my academic priorities will primary encompass the exploration of that field, but I also wish to become an eloquently articulate writer/thinker. A modest amount of my free time will therefore be allocated towards reading/analyzing a combination  of literature and non-fiction books (hence the inclusion of a "Book List" tab on this website). 
		</p>

		<h3 id = "title">Website Purpose</h3>

		<p id = "txtbody">
			I created this website with the goal of documenting my progression throughout my academic career. The website will include all of the major steps I take towards becoming the scholar I wish to be. Among those steps, as I have mentioned, I will include all of the projects I have completed/will complete over the years. While I will most definitely include my successes, I will also include my failures, as I they exemplify the holes in my knowledge that will one day be filled, and they are vital steps I must take on the path to success. Thank you for reading!

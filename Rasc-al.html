			The purpose of this project is to develop a design for a potential space station at the point L1 where spacecraft can dock to refuel/repair/upgrade their vessels. Because the project is in its infancy, updates about the status of the project will not be written here until after around December of 2022. More information about this project can be found on NASA's website.

			The Automated Dice Roller was designed for individuals who struggle with fine motor movements in their hands. The primary goal was to make a device that could roll dice with the push of a large and easy-to-push button.

			This project was completed for my ECEN 1400, Intro to Digital and Analog Electronics class during fall of 2022. My team and I worked with <i><a href = "https://www.imaginecolorado.org/">Imagine!</a></i> to develop the functionality of the dice roller. Meeting with the individuals at <i>Imagine!</i> helped us consolidate the design of the roller. We received valuable input regarding the their preferences for the design.

			A prototype of the dice roller can be seen below. Many of the 3D Printed parts were printed incorrectly-they were misaligned or mis-sized. The box was also constructed very crudely and the motor was undervolted so it did not supply the adequate torque to rotate the box.

			The electronics were housed within the walls of the device. The electrical componenets included a Stepper Motor, a Stepper Motor driver, an Arduino Nano, two 18650 Lithium Ion batteries, a 5V voltage regulator, and capacitors.

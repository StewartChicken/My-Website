			This dice roller is being created with the hopes of helping those who individuals who lack fine motor control in their hands. The idea is that now, with the push of an ergonomic button, people who lack dexterity in their hands can play games that involve dice with their friends and family. This project will grant me more hands on experience in working with engineering teams and applying my knowledge to tangible applications. The final rendition of this project will be given to a real person. The prospect of creating a product that may help an individual in need makes this project so much more valuable and meaningful in the scope of my education and personal development.

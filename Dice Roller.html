			This project was completed for my ECEN 1400, Intro to Digital and Analog Electronics class during fall of 2022. My team and I worked with <i><a href = "https://www.imaginecolorado.org/">Imagine!</a></i> to develop the functionality of the dice roller. Meeting with the individuals at <i>Imagine!</i> helped us consolidate the design of the roller. We received valuable input regarding the their preferences for the design.

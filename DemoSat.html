			The DemoSat program provides Space Grant teams with low-cost access to the edge of space.  Students are challenged to design, fabricate, launch, recover, and analyze data from balloon payloads on which they design their own experiments ranging from atmospheric characterization to bacteria experiments and technology demonstrations. The students will consruct "payloads" out of inexpensive materials upon which they can mount various sensors or detectors. On oaunch day, the payloads will be taken up to the stratosphere via a large hydrogen filled balloon where the readings from the sensors will be explored.

			This project will be complete by December of 2022 and will allow me to gain a lot of hands on experience in the domain of interdisciplinary engineering collaboration. I will learn a lot about software engineering, embedded systems, electronics, and cooperation between different skillsets.
